Calculated GC bias of cell free DNA (cfDNA) fragments in sample: {{ snakemake.wildcards.SAMPLE }}.

## How to read the figure

The figure shows the GC bias of cfDNA fragments in the sample and their distribution across the respective dimensions.

The x-axis shows the GC content of the fragments in percent, the y-axis shows the fragment length of the fragments in base pairs, 
and the intensity of the color shows the ratio between expected and observed fragments. 
Additionally, The plots on the axes shows how the fragments are distributed across the respective dimensions.
